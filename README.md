# Senior Project: Coral Dev Board Real-time Edge Analytics of Human Pose and Face
Senior Project using TensorFlow Lite on a Coral Dev Board to leverage edge analytics on human pose and face recognition and detection.

## Project Information
Below is a quick outline of relevant information for the project.

#### About Me
* Name: Tom Hood
* Majors: Applied Mathematics & Computer Science
    * Minors: Data Analytics
* Semester: Spring 2020

#### Goals of Project
This project sets out with the goal to develop scripts using Python and TensorFlow on a portable Coral Dev Board. Specifically, these scripts will be used for real-time human pose and face recognition. The Coral Dev Board will be using an attached camera to stream in video data and use real-time analytics to estimate and gauge poses and faces. Because this device is both sensing/collecting and analyzing data it is considered an edge analytics device.

## My Project
The below sections are pertinent to my own senior project, which is using the Coral Dev Board and TensorFlow lite to run software to detect human pose and faces

#### Facial Recognition
Facial recognition is an increasingly popular use case for machine learning. Many sophisticated security systems use facial detection software to identity humans who may be committing a crime or other offense. New advancements in artificial intelligence are trying to incorporate facial recognition into their robots to increase their capabilities for communicating with humans. Facial recognition lays the foundations for more advanced actions such as emotion detection, eye-contact, and facing active speakers.
