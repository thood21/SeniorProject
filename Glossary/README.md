# Glossary
This is a collection of definitions and explanations for jargon, libraries, and methodologies that are commonly used in this project. This would be useful to read over before beginning, or even using as a reference during your own project.



#### Jargon and Terminology
   - **Artificial Intelligence:** Within the realm of computer science, artificial intelligence is some level of intellect or ability demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. 
   - **Classifier:** A function or process that typically takes inputs such as a model, training dataset, test dataset, and validation dataset and attempts to assign data points to their inferred categories or classes.
   - **Detection:** The ability for a prediction-based or classification-based model to correctly identify or otherwise recognize an input.
   - **Machine Learning:** The study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. 
   - **Model:** A descriptive diagram of relationships between various types of information that are to be stored in a data collection system, or, in programming language, created as an object that can be referenced later.
   - **Prediction:** The ability to infer an unknown future value given historic and/or current data. Prediction is used often in various analysis such as time-series and forecasting.
   - **Tensor:** Within the realm of mathematics, this is an object that describes a relationship between various sets of algebraic objects that are related to a vector space. Within the realm of TensorFlow, a tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes.



#### Libraries, Modules, and Packages
   - **MatPlotLib:** A fully-featured and advanced plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+
   - **Mendel Linux:** A lightweight derivative of Debian Linux that runs on a number of Coral development boards, such as the Dev Board and SoM. This derivative was developed to support Coralâ€˜s hardware by providing a version of Debian that produced initial bootable eMMC images and supported Google-specific peripherals.
   - **NumPy:** A scientific programming package for Python that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Because of advanced practices such as vectorization, NumPy allows programmers to create highly optimized and efficient code for machine learning. 
   - **Object_Detection.Utils:** TensorFlow-developed object detection API. This allows developers to easily create, maintain, deploy, and use object detection models, as well as train new ones using transfer learning.
   - **TensorFlow:**  A free and open-source software library that is heavily used and contributed to by Google for research and production. Used for dataflow and differentiable programming within a wide variety of tasks. Because of this, it is extremely useful for machine learning applications such as neural networks or construction advanced models. TensorFlow has a plethora of APIs for a variety of programming languages and devices.



#### Methodologies and Techniques
   - **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, natural language processing, and financial time series.
   - **Edge Analytics:** An approach to data collection and analysis in which an automated analytical computation is performed on data at a sensor, network switch or other device instead of waiting for the data to be sent back to a centralized data store. The Coral Dev Board is a new, ultra-portable rendition of an edge-analytics device.
   - **Image Processing*:** In computer science, digital image processing is the use of a computer to process images through an algorithm. In data science, images can be used as inputs for a model for training, testing, and validating a wide variety of machine learning or artificial intelligence systems.
   - **Transfer Learning:** The ability for storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks, airplanes, or other vehicles.
